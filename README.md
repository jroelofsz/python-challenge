# Python Challenge - Module 3



## Tasks:

### PyBank

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of my company. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset was composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

My task was to create a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following values:

- [x] The total number of months included in the dataset
- [x] The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- [x] The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- [x] The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- [x] The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### PyPoll

In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset was composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My task was to create a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following values:

- [x] The total number of votes cast
- [x] A complete list of candidates who received votes
- [x] The percentage of votes each candidate won
- [x] The total number of votes each candidate won
- [x] The winner of the election based on popular vote
